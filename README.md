CS 407/560Homework 2ObjectivesThe purpose of this assignment is to practice a little more advance graphical layout than you did in HW1 and improve your skills in the areas below:•Using constraint layouts to design user interfaces•Usingwidgets and events to change content dynamicallyin a graphical user interfaceWhat to do?In this assignment, you will create an app named HW2_PizzaOrderthat can be used to calculate the price of a pizza order. Specifically, the app must have the following:

* The user should be presented a way to choose a pizza from a given pizza list. The list should contain at least 4 different pizzas. The pizzas must be selected from a *listview* or from a *spinner*.
* When the user chooses a pizza from the list, the app should display the image of that pizza (sample pizza images have been attached to this assignment). For example, if a user chooses a peperoni pizza from the list, an image of peperoni pizza should be displayed on the screen.
* To select a pizza size, the user must be presented with at least 3 radio buttonswith the specified prices as follows:
    * Medium ($9.99)
    * Large ($13.99)
    * X-Large ($15.99)
* To choose different types of toppings (e.g., extra cheese, onions) for the selected pizza, the user must be presented with at least 4 check boxes. Each topping may be priced at the same price such as *$1.69*.
* To indicate whether or not this order will be delivery, the user must be presented with a *switch* (e.g., yes, no). For example, there can be a fixed delivery charge of *$2* per order.
* The app should calculate and display the total price of the pizza order according to size, number of toppings and whether or not delivery is required.
